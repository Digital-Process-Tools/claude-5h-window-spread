# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues privately, through this repository's **Security** tab ->
**Report a vulnerability**. Do not open a public issue for anything exploitable.

Include what you did, what happened, and what you expected. A proof of concept helps
and is not required.

## What to expect

An acknowledgement, then an assessment of severity. Anything in these classes is fixed
and released before it is discussed publicly:

- **destroys** -- data is gone with no copy anywhere
- **discloses** -- something private leaves the machine
- **containment** -- code reaches outside the directory it was given

## Scope

This project runs inside a developer's session with access to their files and their
credentials. Reports about that boundary are in scope and are taken seriously, including
ones where the failure needs an unusual configuration to reach.
